WHEAT 0.2-alpha
----------

This branch contains the source code for WHEAT, an extension of BFT-SMART (based on version 1.1-beta) that implements the optimizations and vote assignment schemes described in [1]. It can be lanuched in the same way as the standard library. 

Example (for the counter demo):

$ java -cp ./bin/*:./lib/* bftsmart.demo.counter.CounterServer 0
$ java -cp ./bin/*:./lib/* bftsmart.demo.counter.CounterServer 1
$ java -cp ./bin/*:./lib/* bftsmart.demo.counter.CounterServer 2
$ java -cp ./bin/*:./lib/* bftsmart.demo.counter.CounterServer 3
$ java -cp ./bin/*:./lib/* bftsmart.demo.counter.CounterServer 4

$ java -cp ./bin/*:./lib/* bftsmart.demo.counter.CounterClient 1001 10

To configure the vote assigment scheme, it is necessary to:

1) sort the replicas IDs from fastest to slowest in ./config/system.config;
2) set the "useWeights" parameter to "true".

Example for 5 replicas (BFT mode, f = 1, delta = 1):

system.initial.view = 4,0,1,2,3
system.useweights = true

The code will automatically compute the values delta, u and Vmax discussed in [1] during start-up. Bear in mind that this code is highly experimental, and only runned in fault-free executions.

Finally, do not forget to always erase the ./config/currentView file after changing N, F, or the order of replicas. This file stores information about the system view, and if it exists, WHEAT/SMART assumes the data from that file instead of creating it again from the settings available in the configuration files.

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions!
